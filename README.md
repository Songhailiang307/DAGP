* A deep autoencoder compression-based genomic prediction method for whole-genome sequencing data.

* This script executes the DAGP method, including genotype one-hot encoding, data division, data combining, and genomic prediction using GBLUP, Bayesian, and machine learning methods.

* This script will store the results in a text file, including prediction accuracy, unbiasedness, mse and mae.
